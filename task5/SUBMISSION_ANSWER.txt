For this highly scalable web application, I designed a three-tier architecture spread across multiple availability zones to handle 10,000 concurrent users. Users access the application through Route 53 DNS, which directs traffic to CloudFront CDN for static content delivery and caching at edge locations worldwide. Dynamic requests go through an Application Load Balancer in public subnets, which distributes traffic across an Auto Scaling Group of EC2 instances (4-20 instances) in private subnets. The application tier connects to Amazon RDS Multi-AZ for relational data and ElastiCache Redis for session management and caching, both in private database subnets. For security, I've implemented multiple layers including WAF at the CloudFront level for SQL injection and XSS protection, Security Groups and NACLs for network isolation, and AWS Secrets Manager for credential management. CloudWatch monitors all components with alarms for CPU, memory, and error rates, while CloudTrail logs all API calls for audit purposes. S3 stores static assets and application logs with lifecycle policies for cost optimization.
