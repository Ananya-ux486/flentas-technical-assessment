For this task, I created a VPC with the CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16, giving us plenty of IP addresses to work with. I split the network into four subnets spread across two availability zones (us-east-1a and us-east-1b) to ensure high availability. The public subnets (10.0.1.0/24 and 10.0.2.0/24) are for resources that need direct internet access through the Internet Gateway, while the private subnets (10.0.11.0/24 and 10.0.12.0/24) are for backend services that connect to the internet securely through a NAT Gateway. This setup keeps our private resources protected while still allowing them to reach external services when needed.

VPC CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16 (65,536 IP addresses)
Public Subnet 1: 10.0.1.0/24 (251 usable IPs) in us-east-1a
Public Subnet 2: 10.0.2.0/24 (251 usable IPs) in us-east-1b
Private Subnet 1: 10.0.11.0/24 (251 usable IPs) in us-east-1a
Private Subnet 2: 10.0.12.0/24 (251 usable IPs) in us-east-1b

I chose 10.0.0.0/16 for the VPC because it provides 65,000+ IP addresses, which is more than enough for future expansion. It's also a standard private IP range that won't conflict with public internet addresses. For the subnets, I used /24 masks giving 251 usable IPs each. The public subnets start at 10.0.1.0 and 10.0.2.0 for easy identification. I intentionally left a gap and started private subnets at 10.0.11.0 and 10.0.12.0 so there's room to add more public subnets later if needed without reorganizing everything.
